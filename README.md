# foodme-sinatra-project
A food review application built on Sinatra

This application allows you keep track of all the dishes you eat out at restuaurants.  Unlike many other food review sites, this application focuses primarily on the actual dish you eat.  Users can easily share their individual page containing all their dish reviews.  No more having to find a restaurant, then dig through the reviews to find feedback on the dish you are interested in. 

The FoodMe Review application allows you to:
1. Login or Signup with your own account
2. View your FoodMe Reviews, All Reviews, or any other user's FoodMe Reviews.
3. Create, Edit, and Delete your FoodMe Reviews.
4. You can also share your user page and vistors do you have to login to view.
